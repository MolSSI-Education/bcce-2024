   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "SMILES stands for \"Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System\" and is a way to represent molecules as a string of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the molecule ethanol. The image below shows a representation that we are used to seeing in chemistry:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ethanol](Images/ethanol.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the SMILES representation of this molecule would be \"CCO\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about SMILES at [this tutorial](https://archive.epa.gov/med/med_archive_03/web/html/smiles.html), but rules for atoms and bonds are also repeated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atoms\n",
    "SMILES supports all elements in the periodic table. An atom is represented using its respective atomic symbol. Upper case letters refer to non-aromatic atoms; lower case letters refer to aromatic atoms. If the atomic symbol has more than one letter the second letter must be lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonds\n",

    "#\tTriple bond\n",
    "*\tAromatic bond\n",
    ".\tDisconnected structures\n",
    "```\n",
    "Single bonds are the default and therefore need not be entered. For example, 'CC' would mean that there is a non-aromatic carbon attached to another non-aromatic carbon by a single bond, and the computer would identify the structure as the chemical ethane. It is also assumed that the bond between two lower case atom symbols is aromatic. A blank terminates the SMILES string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "A branch from a chain is specified by placing the SMILES symbol(s) for the branch between parenthesis. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "CC(O)C\t2-Propanol\n",
    "CC(=O)C\t2-Propanone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "A ring is specified by placing a number directly after the SMILES symbol where the ring closure occurs. This number acts as a marker, indicating that the atoms with the same number are connected, thus forming a ring. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C1CCCC1 cyclopentane\n",
    "n1ccccc1\tPyridine\n",

We will be using the Python interface to RDKit, though there are interfaces in other languages.\n",

Generally, each individual tree is not that good at making a prediction, but collectively the trees are quite good at making predictions.

Each tree also has a depth(``max_depth``) which specifies the maximum number of splits a tree can have, with the default value being no limit on the depth ('None'). Too few trees or trees that are too shallow results in a model that predicts poorly due to underfitting the data--the model is too simple to predict using train or test data.
